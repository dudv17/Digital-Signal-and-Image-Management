# Digital Signal and Image Management
This repository contains the project work for the course of "Digital Signal and Image Management" as part of the Master of Science program in Data Science at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca. The project is divided into three parts as follows:
* **1D - Human Activity Recognition**: Explore and implement various machine learning techniques for Human Activity Recognition using smartphone sensor data. The dataset used is the [**WISDM dataset**](https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php), that contains accelerometer readings from smartphones worn by individuals performing different activities like walking, jogging, sitting, etc.
* **2D - Facial Expression Recognition**:  Build a facial expression recognition system using the [FER](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and [FER+](https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus) datasets. The idea is to train a model that will be able to predict the emotion expressed in a picture of a human face.
* **Retrieval - What's Your Famous Lookalike**: The objective of this project is to employ retrieval techniques to identify the most similar VIP image to a given input from the [CelebA](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset. For this purpose, various models and distance metrics and evaluation techniques will be used to interpret the results.
